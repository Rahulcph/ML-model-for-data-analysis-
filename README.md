# ML Event Participation Analysis
This project analyzes participation data from three machine learning events using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn). It provides insights into overall participation trends, breakdowns by job profile, location, organization, and experience level. The analysis includes visualizations and summary statistics to support data-driven decisions for future events.
